# rtl88x2eu-20230815
Linux Driver for WiFi Adapters that are based on the RTL8812EU and RTL8822EU Chipsets - v5.15.0.1  
``` rtl88x2EU_rtl88x2CU-VE_WiFi_linux_v5.15.0.1-186-g768722062.20230815_COEX20230616-330a-beta.tar.gz ```  

I've asked LB-LINK (a Wi-Fi module vendor) for any RTL8812EU driver. Then he send me this tar.   
So, it should work with RTL8812EU and RTL8822EU.   

According to the file name, it may work with RTL8812CU or RTL8822CU (if exists). But you should use in-kernel driver instead.

However, it's not been tested yet. Will update this readme till I get my RTL8812EU hardware.
